  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Death reflection is the deliberate contemplation and contextualization of one’s mortality, and is often explored in
    traditional media and art forms, such as novels, theatre, and film; but how can new media be used to encourage death
    reflection? This paper proposes an installation that aims to foster death reflection and existential contemplation.
    The Death and Existential Virtual Environment (DEVE) will consist of a room with a virtual environment projected
    onto
    a 360 degree screen. When a participant enters the room, they will be invited to communicate with a projected
    virtual agent (a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) agent) about death and existence in a question and
    answer discussion format.</p>

  <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
  <p>Why is it necessary to reflect on death? Death anxiety is the feeling of panic, fear, or worry caused by thoughts
    of death or of being detached from the world. Studies have shown a significant link between death anxiety and
    depression, as well as existential concerns and depressive disorders <dt-cite key="khademi2021"></dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="menzies2020"></dt-cite>, and as people all across the world grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, death
    anxiety is something many are struggling with. When examining the pandemic, much of the behavioural and emotional
    responses exhibited by people, such as suppressing thoughts of death by refraining from reading or viewing news on
    the pandemic, denying one’s vulnerability to the virus, or trying to prevent death from the virus through excessive
    cleaning, can be understood through terror management theory (TMT), which proposes that fear of death drives much of
    human behaviour. While some develop adaptive ways of coping with this fear, such as building meaningful
    relationships or leaving a positive legacy, others develop maladaptive coping behaviours <dt-cite key="menzies2020">
    </dt-cite>, such as the outright denial of the virus which leads to reckless behaviour. However, while death anxiety
    and avoidance can severely affect psychological well-being, research has shown that death reflection can contribute
    to greater mental well-being and enjoyment of life <dt-cite key="chittaro2018"></dt-cite>
    <dt-cite key="spitzenstätter2020"></dt-cite>.
  </p>
  <p>Death anxiety operates at the “hot” or experiential system based on a heuristic processing of death, i.e. the
    immediate formation of decisions and conclusions without much thought process, prompting impulsive self-protective
    responses in the form of inflexible worldviews. Death reflection on the other hand operates at the
    “cool” or rational system, and involves engaging in analytic and deliberate contemplation of the meaning of
    mortality <dt-cite key="zhong2021"></dt-cite>. In recent studies, researchers conclude that rather than respond with
    hostility and self-protection after contemplating death or encountering death-related stimuli, some people show
    attitudes and behaviours focused on helping others and the world <dt-cite key="yuan2019"></dt-cite>. A study by
    Cozzolino et al. <dt-cite key="cozzolino2004"></dt-cite>, for example, found that participants in the death
    reflection condition tended to increase naturally unselfish behaviors, and Frias et al. <dt-cite key="frias2011">
    </dt-cite> too found that participants in the death reflection condition in their study showed enhanced gratitude
    compared with those in the death anxiety condition<dt-cite key="yuan2019"></dt-cite>. Similarly, the findings in a
    study by Blackie et al. <dt-cite key="blackie2016"></dt-cite> suggest that existential contemplation has
    implications
    for well-being enhancement.</p>

  <h2>2 Related Work</h2>
  <p>Today, conversational AI is being used for mental health care, such as providing clinicians with feedback on their
    psychotherapy, assessing language patterns of successful crisis interventions in text-based mental health
    conversations, and helping to increase engagement from those who may consider traditional talk therapy as
    stigmatizing, for issues such as PTSD, clinical depression, and adolescent stress <dt-cite key="miner2019">
    </dt-cite>. For
    instance, Xiaoice, a Microsoft chatbot designed to provide general social interaction and emotional support, has
    reportedly been used by over 100 million people worldwide <dt-cite key="ho2018"></dt-cite>.</p>
  <p>When utilizing conversational AI for human-computer interaction scenarios, it may not be enough to simply use text
    and/or voice input and output as an interface. In a study by Pontier & Siddiqui <dt-cite key="pontier2008">
    </dt-cite>
    , a virtual agent guides users through the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire, which is used to measure
    the severity of depression. The agent responds empathically to the answers given by the user by changing its facial
    expression, thus it resembles face to face therapy more than existing web-based self-help therapies. A response from
    several participants was that the virtual agent felt more personal and friendlier, and that it was more fun to
    perform the questionnaire with the virtual agent. In another virtual agent study by Montoro <dt-cite
      key="montoro2008"></dt-cite>, researchers found that the use of the virtual agent can result in a higher degree of
    naturalness and “humanity” to the interaction with the system, with almost half of the participants (48%) preferring
    to interact with the virtual agent, while only 14% considered that they preferred interacting with the system
    without
    the virtual agent. Based on subjective experience, numerous reports indicate that interactions with animated agents
    are perceived by users to be engaging, entertaining, believable, comfortable, and usable <dt-cite key="heller2009">
    </dt-cite>.</p>
  <p>However, caution must be taken when utilizing virtual agents. Cafaro et al. <dt-cite key="cafaro2012">
    </dt-cite> state that people cannot refrain from behaving nonverbally, and if they try to be passive, they may be
    perceived as unexpressive, inhibited, withdrawn, and uptight. Nonverbal behavior plays a fundamental yet subtle role
    in the dynamics of impression management, and virtual agents are not immune to these judgments. In their study,
    findings indicate that results in social psychology research on the assessment of personality traits and attitudes
    on the basis of nonverbal behavior between people also translate to user-agent interaction. Similarly, as Tsaia et
    al. <dt-cite key="tsai2012"></dt-cite> touch upon, emotional contagion, which is the tendency to catch the emotions
    of other people, can also come about with the use of virtual agents, and applications should accurately account for
    it. In their study, they found that even a still image can have an emotional effect, and they state that as virtual
    agents extend beyond entertainment into emotionally-charged domains such as psychotherapy, the emotional impacts
    they might have on users must be taken into account.</p>

  <h2>3 Methodology</h2>
  <p>Through DEVE’s virtual agent, the participant will be given a sense of comfort, allowing them to feel as if they
    are communicating with another being. The virtual agent will have a mask-like face but will not have a body. The
    face will be human-like in appearance, but only enough to create a sense of familiarity while still remaining
    otherworldly, as if the participant is freely communicating to the universe itself. This will make it so that
    the participant feels as though they are communicating with something outside of their regular world, and perhaps
    allow them to feel reassured that anything that is communicated while in the space, will stay in the space. Through
    the use of appropriate gestures and facial expressions, the agent will be able to convey empathy as it accompanies
    the participant on a journey of death reflection.</p>

  <iframe src="embed1.html" class="embed l-middle" width="800" height="410"></iframe>

  <p>As for DEVE’s projected environment, as de Melo & Paiva <dt-cite key="demelo2009"></dt-cite> point out, digital
    technology is a ﬂexible medium for the expression of emotions, and in a virtual environment this can be achieved
    through the manipulation of certain elements such as light and colour. For instance, when mainly looking at Western
    cultures, well lit scenes can be regarded as happy and cheerful, while poorly lit scenes are mysterious and sad; red
    is associated with excitement or aggression, and blue with quiet or calmness <dt-cite key="demelo2005"></dt-cite>.
    DEVE
    will present different emotions experienced by the participant as they communicate with the virtual agent, by
    mapping these emotions to the light, colour, and 3D textures of the projected environment.</p>

  <iframe src="embed2.html" class="embed l-middle" width="800" height="410"></iframe>

  <p>Two techniques will be used to capture data for the triggering of the visual effects in the virtual environment.
    The first technique will use emotional analysis, a subcategory of natural language processing (NLP), which involves
    extracting specific emotions such as fear, joy, and sadness from speech and text through keyword recognition
    <dt-cite key="lei2021"></dt-cite>. In the case of DEVE, the emotions inferred from the participant’s speech, will be
    used to manipulate light and colour. The second technique will use the Performance and Art Cyber-Interoceptive
    System (PACIS), a wearable wireless device for analyzing real-time biophysical signals such as heart and brain
    signals <dt-cite key="hosale2019"></dt-cite>. This will be used for the manipulation of the 3D textures, creating
    dynamic motion of
    the projected environment matching the energy of the participant’s biosignals. Having a visual representation of
    their emotions generated in real-time will allow participants to better connect with themselves and encourage an
    understanding of
    their own inner dialogue throughout the experience.
  </p>

  <h2>4 Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Death is something that all humans grapple with throughout their lives, and with the COVID-19 pandemic, death
    anxiety has taken a strong hold of the psychies of many. This proposed installation will examine three primary
    questions: a) how can AI agents be used to encourage human participants to reflect on uncomfortable subject matter
    such as death and their own mortality?; b) how effective is bio-sensory data in tracking emotional responses for
    affective computing?; and c) how does visual stimuli such as colour and light intensity representing different
    emotional states help encourage self reflection? A heightened awareness of death needn’t bring about fear and
    anxiety. Instead, through the use of new interactive technologies such as DEVE, this awareness can help to promote
    mental health and well-being.</p>
